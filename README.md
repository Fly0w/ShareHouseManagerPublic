2. Clone the repository in your local computer
3. Install the dependencies by using the following command

```bash
npm install
```

### Database

This app is powered by a Firebase Database, and thus the access is restricted to the owner of the website.

1. Create your own firebase database, and enable those 2 services : Authentication and Firestore.
2. Go in the "src > includes > firebase.js" file, and replace the firebaseConfig with the one provided by firestore service in firebase :

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: API_KEY,
  authDomain: AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: APP_ID
}
```

3. In the App.Vue file, uncomment the mounted() lifeCycle action

```javascript
  async mounted() {
    this.createAuthAndFirestoreDB(this.a)
    this.setBike()
    this.setChores(this.b, this.c)
    this.setEventList()
  }
```

> **Note :**
> The credentials are located in the App.Vue state, in the variable called "a". Feel free to change those **before uncommenting the mounted() action** if you want to customize your credentials:

```javascript
data() {
    return {
      tab: 'Chores',
      loggedUser: '',
      userTabTrigger: false,
      logoutBtnMsg: 'Logout',
      a: {
        A101: {
          ...
          residentName: 'Resident 1',
          roomPassword: 'testpassword'
        },
        A1021: {
          ...
          residentName: 'Resident 2',
          roomPassword: 'testpassword'
        },
        A1022: {
           ...
```

4. Once everything is setup, run the following command and open a browser tab with the displayed adress:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open the developper tool and enable the smartphone view, then refresh the page to see the Login Form appear.

6. Once this Form appears, try logging in with the credentials given below. If it works, you can comment back the mounted() function in the App.Vue file.

## Login

The credentials are located in the App.Vue state, in the variable called "a":

```javascript
data() {
    return {
      tab: 'Chores',
      loggedUser: '',

**Garbage days :**
The chores tab gathers the grocery chore and the garbage chore in one tab. It allows the residents to see the next garbage day, with the different types of garbage to take out. The ribbon is updated automatically, according to the data input in the App.vue file's state "b", more precisely in "daysWeek":

```javascript
data() {
    return {
      b: {
        rotation: {
          0: ['B104', 'B201'],
          ...
        },
        daysWeek: [
          {
            icon: [],
            nextAction: {
              day: 'Tomorrow night',
              type: ['Burn']
            },
            id: 0,
            text: 'Sun'
          },
          {
            nextAction: {
              day: 'Tonight',
              type: ['Burn']
            },
            id: 1,
            icon: ['Throw'],
            text: 'Mon'
